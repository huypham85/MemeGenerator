# MemeGenerator

An iOS app for creating memes with a modular and scalable design. Built with SwiftUI, MVVM, and modern Swift features, this project simplifies development and enables reusability across components.

## Modular Architecture  

The project is split into distinct modules for clarity and reusability:  

### **CoreModule**  
- **Networking**: Protocol-driven API calls.  
- **Persistence**: Abstractions for saving/loading data (supports Realm).  
- **Utilities**: Shared helpers for colors, images, and error handling.
